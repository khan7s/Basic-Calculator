# Basic-Calculator
This code includes three files: index.html, styles.css, and script.js. The HTML file sets up the structure of the calculator, the CSS file styles it, and the JavaScript file provides the functionality. Save these files in the same directory and open index.html in a web browser to see the simple calculator in action.
