# Basic-Calculator
This project includes three files: index.html, styles.css, and script.js. 
The HTML file sets up the structure of the calculator, the CSS file styles it, and the JavaScript file provides the functionality. 
I will try to host this pages on github so it can be open from web browser to see the simple calculator in action.
